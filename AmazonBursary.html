        <p class="text-gray-700">The Amazon Recruitment Bursary was launched in 2018 by Amazon Development Centre for people from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. Successful applicants will receive funding from Amazon to cover tuition fees, accommodation and additional academic costs. Additionally, successful applicants must be committed to completing a paid Amazon internship (in summer vacation) during which applicants are assessed for a full-time permanent Software Development Engineer (SDE) role to start upon graduation. Amazon is a place where motivated employees thrive and where employee ownership and accountability lead to meaningful results.</p>
